THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

This is an example React app - put together very quickly - that illustrates one way of using [`calendar-model`](https://github.com/joe-crick/calendar-model). It builds a simple calendar 
with a few events on it in each month. The calendar navigates the months of the current year in a
loop.
